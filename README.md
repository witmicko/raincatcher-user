# FeedHenry RainCatcher user [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-user.png)](https://travis-ci.org/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-user)

A module for FeedHenry RainCatcher that manages users, groups and memberships. It provides :
- Backend services to handle CRUD operations for user, group and membership.
- Frontend directives and services providing CRUD clients for user, group and membership.

## Upgrading to 0.2.0 from 0.1.x
Version 0.2.0 introduces session storage for authenticated users utilizing either MongoDB or Redis as storage engines.

This involves an extra parameter to the initialization of the router for the authentication service which contains the configuration for the session storage.

### How to upgrade

In the MBaaS service that authenticates users (e.g. [raincatcher-demo-auth](https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-demo-auth)), initialise the session store with the configuration shown below.

```javascript
const userRouter = require('fh-wfm-user/lib/router/mbaas');

userRouter.init(
  mediator, // fh-wfm-mediator instance
  expressApp, // express application upon which to mount the router
  ['password'], // list of fields from Users to exclude from the HTTP responses

  // Session storage configuration, new in 0.2.0
  {
    store: 'mongo', // The store to utilize for session storage,
                    // current available values are ['mongo', 'redis']
    config: {
      // the following parameters are forwarded to express-session
      secret: 'raincatcher',
      resave: false,
      saveUninitialized: true,
      cookie: {
        secure: true,
        httpOnly: true,
        path: '/'
      }
      // `url` is used by the 'mongo' store for configuration
      url: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/raincatcher-demo-auth-session-store'
      // 'host' and 'port' are used by the 'redis' store
      host: '127.0.0.1',
      port: '6379'
    }
  },

  function callback(err) {
    // router initialized
  })
```

Version 0.2.1 introduced encryption of the users profile data in localstorage (fh.wfm.profileData). The user will likely need to clear the app data/cache in their phones system settings for this feature to work, as previous plaintext profile data may be left on the phone causing an error when trying to decrypt it. To clear the app data on Android: 

* Step 1: Head to the Settings menu. This can be done by tapping the cog icon in your notification shade.
* Step 2: Find Apps (or Applications, depending on your device) in the menu, then locate the app that you want to clear the cache or data for.
* Step 3: Tap on Storage and the buttons for clearing the cache and app data will become available.


## Upgrading to 0.1.0 from 0.0.x
Version 0.1.0 introduces secure authentication along with password hashing. Password update for users is available as part of the updated [raincatcher-demo-portal](https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-demo-portal) (available in Workers > Worker details > Edit)

### How to upgrade
Update your mobile application, portal application, cloud application and auth service to utilize version 0.1.x of `fh-wfm-user`.
Update your auth service to reflect changes in [raincatcher-demo-auth](https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-demo-auth/pull/23)

You will also need to hash your users' passwords using the new hashing algorithm, utilizing one of the following options:
- Manually editing the users' passwords through the updated portal app
- If you already have user passwords stored in a custom persistent storage implementation, run a single-pass migration to store them as hashed strings instead. See [this example](./examples/hashing-migration.js).

## Client-side usage

### Client-side usage (via broswerify)

#### Setup
This module is packaged in a CommonJS format, exporting the name of the Angular namespace.  The module can be included in an angular.js as follows:

```javascript
angular.module('app', [
, require('fh-wfm-user')
...
])
```

#### Integration

##### Angular Services

This module provides 3 injectable CRUDL services :

- `userClient` : to create, read, list, update and delete users.
- `groupClient` : to create, read, list, update and delete groups.
- `membershipClient` : to create, read, list, update and delete groups.

the `userClient` has these extra functions : `auth`, `hasSession`, `clearSession`, `verify` and `getProfile`

Example usage :
```javascript
resolve: {
        worker: function($stateParams, userClient) {
          return userClient.read($stateParams.workerId);
        }
```
For a more complete example around CRUD operations, please check the [demo portal app](https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-demo-portal/blob/master/src/app/worker/worker.js).

For a more complete example around user authentication operations, please check the [this](https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-demo-portal/blob/master/src/app/auth/auth.js).

##### Directives

| Name | Attributes |
| ---- | ----------- |
| worker-list | workers, selectedModel |
| worker | worker, group |
| worker-form | value, group |
| group-list | groups, selectedModel |
| group | group, members |
| group-form | value |

## Usage in an express backend and mbaas service

### Setup express backend end
The server-side component of this RainCatcher module exports a function that takes express and mediator instances as parameters, as in:

```javascript
var express = require('express')
  , app = express()
  , mbaasExpress = mbaasApi.mbaasExpress()
  , mediator = require('fh-wfm-mediator/lib/mediator')
  ;
// Set authServiveGuid
var authServiceGuid = process.env.WFM_AUTH_GUID;

// configure the express app
...

// setup the wfm user router
require('fh-wfm-user/lib/router/cloud')(mediator, app, authServiceGuid);

```

### Setup mbaas service

```javascript
var express = require('express')
  , app = express()
  , mbaasExpress = mbaasApi.mbaasExpress()
  , mediator = require('fh-wfm-mediator/lib/mediator')
  ;
// Set authServiveGuid
var authServiceGuid = process.env.WFM_AUTH_GUID;

// configure the express app
...

// setup the wfm user router
require('fh-wfm-user/lib/router/mbaas')(mediator, app, authResponseExclusionList);
```

Note: Setting the `authResponseExclusionList` array as `['password', 'banner']` will prevent these fields from appearing in the authentication response. By default, the `password` field is removed from the response. To allow all fields to be sent, set `authResponseExclusionList` as an empty array.

For a more complete example check [here](https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-demo-auth)

### Environment variables
The `WFM_AUTH_POLICY_ID` env var can be set in the WFM cloud APP to override the default `wfm` auth policy ID.
